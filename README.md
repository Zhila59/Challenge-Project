# Challenge-Project
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.
I explore dataset by visualization tools and by using different classifier and methods to improve the performance try to follow these objectives:

1. How does the probability of default payment vary by categories of different demographic variables?
2. Which variables are the strongest predictors of default payment?
3. Which classification models can I use ?
4. How can I improve the performance of models?
5.Which models have better performance?
